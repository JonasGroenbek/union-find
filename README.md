# Data structures and algorithms - W6

##### Weighted union find algorithm.
  
  The weighted union find algorithm runs on a fixed size "tree-like" data structure, that canonically gets implemented over arrays.
  The time complexities of the algorithm is highly competitive, which is achieved, through restriction.
##### Assignment
Implement the Union-find algorithms:
• Quick-union
• Weighted-union

##### Implementation
Unionfind implementation - [UnionFind.java](https://github.com/JonasGroenbek/union-find/blob/master/src/main/java/union/UnionFind.java)
